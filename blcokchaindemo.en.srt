1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,100
this is a blockchain demo we're going to

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,410
do this in a very visual way though I'm

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,389
going to make it very easy to understand

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,540
by stepping through the key pieces of

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,660
what a blockchain is in a visual way but

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,190
before we get started we need to take a

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,970
look at this thing that we call a

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,390
sha-256 hash okay and a hash this is

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,769
this is one of them right here

10
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,900
hash looks like a bunch of random

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,840
numbers and essentially what it is it's

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,750
a fingerprint of some digital data and

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,579
it just so happens it's the fingerprint

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,219
of whatever I type in this box so if I

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,120
type my name on theirs into this box you

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,000
see that the hash has changed matter of

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,250
fact it changed every time I typed a

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,860
letter right so I'm going to go back to

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,340
so it says onder's okay so this is a the

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,739
hash of the name onder's all lowercase

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,340
it starts with one 9ea right okay so if

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,890
I delete that and I go again type

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,860
onder's again you can see it starts with

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,220
one 9ei the same exact hash in that

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,200
sense it's a digital fingerprint of this

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,770
data whatever data is here every time

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,869
you type exactly the same data you get

28
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,210
exactly the same hash and I can type

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,189
anything I want so you can have nothing

30
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,580
like this you know III b0 that's that's

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,040
the hash of nothing or you could type

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,590
tons and tons of stuff a matter of fact

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,970
you could put like the Library of

34
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,310
Congress in here and you would get a

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,770
hash and the interesting thing about it

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,860
is regardless of there if there's a tiny

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
amount of information no information or

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,820
the entire Library of Congress you're

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,189
always going to get a hash that is this

40
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,140
long this many characters are you're not

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,110
going to be able to pre guess what this

42
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,540
is you kind of have to put the Library

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,610
of Congress in here to figure out what

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,329
the hash is but you you always get

45
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,840
exactly the same hash regardless of how

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,700
many times you put exactly the same

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,240
information in so what I'm going to do

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,360
is extend this idea of a hash into

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,860
something that we're going to call a

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,170
block alright so let's take a look at a

51
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,370
block so this is a block and it's

52
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,620
exactly like the hash it's just that

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,260
that data section I've broken out now

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,510
into three sections one called block

55
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,280
this is just some kind of a number this

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,280
is block number one on nonce which is

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,410
just yet another number we'll go into

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,030
what that is in a second and then just

59
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,860
some more data just very similarly to

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,129
the way that we had it before

61
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:44,340
however the hash of this which includes

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,250
all of this information up here is down

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,069
here and it begins with four zeros you

64
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,250
see that it's a relatively unusual hash

65
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,410
you know most of them are not really

66
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,239
going to start with four zeros like that

67
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,909
but this one happens to and because it

68
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,790
does totally arbitrarily I'm going to

69
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,970
say that this block is signed okay so

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,090
what would happen if I were to change

71
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,670
any one piece of this information let's

72
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,040
say if I were to type something here

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,920
right the hash is going to change and

74
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,870
what's a chance of if I type letters

75
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,550
this hash is going to start with four

76
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,519
zeros pretty low it's probably not right

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,099
so let's see what happens when I do that

78
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,760
I'm just going to say hi oh look at that

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,310
write this hash does not start with four

80
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,129
zeros and so the big background here is

81
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,799
turned red so now you know that this

82
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,280
this block with this information in it

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,330
is not a valid or assigned block okay

84
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,430
and that's where this nonce comes in

85
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,680
this nonce is just a number that you can

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,060
set to try to find a number that fits so

87
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,430
that this hash starts with four zeros

88
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,170
again all right so how do we do that

89
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,030
well let's start with one does that

90
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,830
start with no it's three two so that's

91
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,760
not one so let's try to FF no three four

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,580
five so actually get the idea like I

93
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,750
could sit here oh there's one that

94
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,819
starts with a zero I could sit here all

95
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,150
day typing these numbers and trying to

96
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,449
figure out one that actually is going to

97
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,070
hash out to something that starts with

98
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,710
four zeros going to take a long time so

99
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,300
here I have my little mind but

100
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,220
I'm sure you've been wondering what

101
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,229
happens if I press that so what's going

102
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,940
to happen when I press this mine button

103
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,370
is it's going to run through all the

104
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,430
numbers from 1 all the way up to try to

105
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,949
find one where the hash starts with 4

106
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,080
zeros in this process is called mine

107
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,629
let's do it right now so now it's

108
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,199
checking all of the numbers from 1 all

109
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,909
the way up look there now it's stopped

110
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:54,340
at 59,000 396 and that one just happens

111
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,889
to hash out to something that starts

112
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,560
with 4 zeros and it satisfies my little

113
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,009
definition of what a signed block is ok

114
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,550
so that's that's a block now can you

115
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,940
tell me what a block chain is it's

116
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,430
probably just a chain of these blocks

117
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,680
well how do you how do you put them

118
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,590
together let's let's do that all right

119
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,509
so here's my block chain I've blocked

120
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,550
number one it has some kind of announced

121
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,770
just like before there's some data area

122
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,590
to it but then it has this previous here

123
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,509
it's a bunch of zeros let's let's roll

124
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,539
forward so this is block 2 and block 3

125
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,599
and for this block chain has 5 blocks on

126
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,409
it right the previous here starts with 0

127
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:42,909
0 a e8 right is this number a e8 and

128
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,770
then this previous you know B 9 0 is

129
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,370
this one over here B 9 0 so you can see

130
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,610
that each block points backwards to the

131
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,129
one before it and you remember that that

132
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,889
first block over here there actually is

133
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,300
no previous so it's just a bunch of

134
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,629
zeros it's actually just a fake number

135
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:09,069
ok so just like we did before what

136
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,919
happens if I change some information

137
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,830
here right it's going to change the hash

138
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,240
of this block and it's going to

139
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,039
invalidate it right well let's try that

140
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:20,500
so I'm going to type PI again sure

141
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,379
enough that block is invalid all right

142
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,020
just as we assumed but what would happen

143
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,090
I'm going to fix that now we'll go back

144
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,889
to something that worked what would

145
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,379
happen if I change something in this

146
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,469
block right it's going to change this

147
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,070
hash but this hash gets copied up too

148
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,010
this previous so it's going to it's

149
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,330
going to change this one too right so it

150
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,360
should break both blocks so let me try

151
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,640
typing hi in there and sure enough all

152
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,360
right so we can go back as far as we

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,790
want you know to some point in the in

154
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,780
the past and break that block and it'll

155
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,850
break all the blocks since then

156
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,460
everything before is still green but

157
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,910
this one is is red it's so if I wanted

158
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,080
to you know change something in this

159
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,190
this block chain I could just go over to

160
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,140
block number five right here we could

161
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,540
change it I'll put hi and then we could

162
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,940
remind it you know and pick a different

163
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,380
knots we'll do that right now and we

164
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,140
could essentially alter the chain so

165
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,970
we've done it so that we should be good

166
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,340
down right alright well what happens if

167
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,220
I go back in time to here and I break it

168
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,920
here now I have to mine this block which

169
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
will pick a nonce that makes this block

170
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,550
hash out to four zeros if we can find

171
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,320
one sometimes it takes a while because

172
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,580
it's got to run through a lot of them

173
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,020
there it is it found one at a hundred

174
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,390
and thirty eight thousand all right but

175
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,430
this one is still broken because

176
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,210
although this one starts with four zeros

177
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,980
adding the four zeros with different

178
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,740
stuff up here still makes this block

179
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,750
hash out incorrectly so I also have to

180
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,830
mine this block all right and that takes

181
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,060
some amount of time that one was a

182
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,800
little bit quicker and then I have to

183
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,970
mine this block to fix it all right so

184
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,900
what we're showing here is that if I go

185
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,840
and change this last block all I have to

186
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,530
do is remind this block if I go way back

187
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,380
in time to back here and I make a change

188
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,979
like that I'm going to have to mine this

189
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,380
one this one this one and this one so

190
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,590
the more blocks that go by the more

191
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,470
blocks in the past that we are the

192
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,810
harder and harder and harder it is to

193
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,470
make a change and so that's how a block

194
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,370
chain is going to resist

195
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,689
mutation resist change okay so now you

196
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,899
like like you know I did if I if if I do

197
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,800
this in this block here you can see that

198
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
I've changed it to hi and a remind at

199
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,430
blah blah blah how would I know that my

200
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,089
block chain has been remind alright

201
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,379
let's take a look at that I'm going to

202
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:21,860
hit this little distributed thing so now

203
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,720
we have a just distributed block chain

204
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,870
it looks exactly like the last block

205
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,970
chain okay up to five the but this is

206
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,879
pure a the first peer if we go down here

207
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,540
you can see here's P or B and it happens

208
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,420
to have an exact copy of the blockchain

209
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,550
there's actually also a P or C down here

210
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,629
right and this could go on forever

211
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,209
there's many many peers out on the

212
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,800
internet and they all have a complete

213
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,519
copy of the blockchain so in this case

214
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,569
if I look at this hash it's 0 e for be

215
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:57,019
alright if I go down to this one I

216
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:01,069
notice it also has a for B if I go down

217
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:03,259
to this last one it has a for B so they

218
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,240
must be identical and I'm going to

219
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,339
demonstrate that by going here

220
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,949
and typing something I'll type hi again

221
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,600
and then I will remind this block I've

222
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,220
got some other number now let's put some

223
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,480
other number up here so I should be able

224
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,769
to mine this block okay now all the

225
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,959
chains are green right they're all green

226
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,089
however this chain says the last hash is

227
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,959
efore B the bottom one says that to e

228
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,899
for B and this middle one here says for

229
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,980
CAE so I know just by glancing at this

230
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,920
one little hash that something is wrong

231
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,740
in this block chain even though all of

232
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,379
the hashes start with four zeros I know

233
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,600
that this one is different and it's

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
different because I have two it's

235
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,889
essentially two against one we're a

236
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,019
little democracy here right this guy

237
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,959
argues that it's efore be this guy

238
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,540
argues that it's four ce4

239
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,509
CA and this one is e for B so e for B

240
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,320
wins so that's how a completely

241
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,130
distributed copy having a copy on many

242
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,920
different computers they can all very

243
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,500
quickly see if all of the blocks are

244
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,240
identical and remember block chains can

245
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,980
have you know four or five hundred

246
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,100
thousand blocks very easily so rather

247
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,779
than checking through all of them all

248
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,339
you really have to do is look at the

249
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,370
hash of the most recent one and you can

250
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,009
see that if anything in the past

251
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,850
anything way back here was altered you

252
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,480
can tell by looking at this at the last

253
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,380
block in this in the chain you know it's

254
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,490
going to hash out to something that

255
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,130
doesn't start with four zeros and looks

256
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,860
very different from what the hash is on

257
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,889
the the good chains are okay so that's a

258
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,839
block chain that's the entire thing

259
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,589
there is no more to it than that but

260
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,860
it's kind of not really useful because

261
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,069
we don't have some something in this

262
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:12,380
data area that means anything I keep

263
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,480
typing my name or hi and it's kind of

264
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,970
that's sort of irrelevant information so

265
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,180
what we really want is a token so let's

266
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,760
do a token on our blockchain all right

267
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,110
now look at this so I have this token

268
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,449
just totally arbitrarily I'm calling

269
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,089
these I guess dollars right so we have

270
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:33,230
25 dollars from Darcy to Bingley four

271
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,480
dollars and twenty seven cents go from

272
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,579
Elizabeth to Jane you get the idea it's

273
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,920
basically there's all these transactions

274
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,660
that are happening and I've just

275
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,920
replaced the data with these

276
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,800
transactions and just like we saw before

277
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,230
you know so there's multiple blocks here

278
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,819
this one has more transit it doesn't

279
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,439
matter how many transactions there are

280
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,750
there can be many or they can be few or

281
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,899
none if we keep going forward in here

282
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,930
just like we saw before if we go down

283
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,759
and we notice we have all these other

284
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,630
copies of the same blockchain right so

285
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,509
now here's where the immutability is

286
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:10,730
important if I change something back

287
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,730
here you'll notice that this is you know

288
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,550
a 7fc blah blah blah it's something it's

289
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,930
something else

290
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,180
so it's something different than what's

291
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,340
down here so in in this way I mean it's

292
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,980
very important that if I were to go back

293
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,440
in time and change some value that we

294
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,440
would notice it's it's very important

295
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,590
with money that you don't lose track and

296
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,300
that's the whole point of using a

297
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,330
blockchain here this is a whole point of

298
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,180
resisting any kind of modifications you

299
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,980
know of things that have happened in the

300
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,910
past so that's the that's the reasoning

301
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,180
behind having using a blockchain to

302
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,080
remember tokens now one thing I would

303
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,730
mention here is that we're not listing

304
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,800
you know Darcy has $100 and he's giving

305
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,230
25 of it to Bingley the only thing we're

306
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,400
saying is Darcy

307
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,800
gives 25 to Bingley we're not

308
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,020
remembering a bank account balance we're

309
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,210
only remembering money movements so this

310
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,930
begs the question does Darcy have 25

311
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,270
dollars well we have a problem here in

312
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,240
this version of the blockchain we don't

313
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,480
actually know if Darcy has 25 dollars so

314
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,530
let's look at a coinbase transaction so

315
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,930
if we look back here a coin base we're

316
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,240
going to add a coinbase transaction to

317
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,190
our blocks and this is this is very

318
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,170
similar to what we've seen before but

319
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,030
we've just adding a coin base at the top

320
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,410
and what's that that what that's saying

321
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,840
is we're going to invent a hundred

322
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,520
dollars out of thin air and give it to

323
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,220
anders and there's no transactions in

324
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,380
this block because nobody had any money

325
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,190
previous to this in the next block

326
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,480
another hundred dollars comes out of

327
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,980
nowhere and goes to honors i'm a fan i

328
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,500
love it right i'll take 100 bucks now we

329
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,450
have some transactions you can see that

330
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,070
they're all from onder's they're all for

331
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,320
me because i'm the only one who has any

332
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,770
money at this point so i'm sending ten

333
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,410
of my dollars to Sophie do I have ten

334
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,780
dollars yeah I do I look back and I see

335
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,000
that this coinbase transaction has given

336
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,250
me a hundred so I have at least ten and

337
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,140
I can send it on and you add all these

338
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,850
up and they don't go over a hundred and

339
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,680
it follows sort of a basic rule

340
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,950
of a currency like you can't invent it

341
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,810
out of thin air you can't create money

342
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,649
out of thin air you it's it's dispersion

343
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,100
is controlled so now if we look at this

344
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,430
blockchain that we've created and we zip

345
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,490
forward in time and we notice that we

346
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,850
see that Jackson is giving Alexa two

347
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,520
dollars and so does Jackson actually

348
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,339
have two dollars to give Alexa well we

349
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,110
go back a block before and we see that

350
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,730
Emily who had gotten ten dollars from

351
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,560
onder's gave ten to Jackson and so

352
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,779
Jackson does have the money so we can

353
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,839
just go backwards and and find that out

354
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,300
that's actually one of the benefits of

355
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,240
having a previous here it's easy to go

356
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,250
backwards we we just look for the block

357
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,410
that looks like that that has that hash

358
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,420
and here it is right here right so you

359
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,490
points two blocks back in time and

360
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,250
allows us to trace the provenance of any

361
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,060
coin that we want so that's a basic

362
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,010
blockchain and we're running a currency

363
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,470
on top of it and as you know block

364
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,990
chains are there many copies everybody

365
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,470
has a copy of it so if we mutate you

366
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,420
know this and make it six dollars these

367
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,850
go invalid it does not agree with with

368
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,880
these block chains down here these

369
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,100
copies of the same blockchain down here

370
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,640
so this resists tampering which is what

371
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,029
you want for a currency it works very

372
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,330
well for things that are small and

373
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,939
transactional like like this go ahead

374
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,920
and fix that and there they're of just a

375
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,939
very efficient way to handle agreement

376
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,270
on what has happened in the past it's

377
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,939
kind of this immutable history that that

378
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,110
goes goes down with time so that's a

379
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,600
basic blockchain and a token on it there

380
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,380
we're glossing over some main points but

381
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,460
if you dig into the demo and and click

382
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,559
through these things and play around

383
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,940
with it you'd get a better and better

384
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,850
idea of how this works there will be a

385
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,100
part two where we go into a little bit

386
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,380
more

387
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,049
detail about how the transactions are

388
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,000
created till then
